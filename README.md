# Web-Development
# ** Analiza Mejia **

Before college I had only had one class in computer science, but was nothing like any of the courses I have taken so far. Which is why I have found interest in multiple classes I have taken, a class that I have taken and really enjoyed is Software Engineering, Although we were first a group of 7 it soon minimized to 4 people which did make our workload to grow. We developed a website that was meanT to show how point of sales works. We chose to make a POKE mart, here users are be able to buy items. The project was challenging becasue I hadn't really worked in any big project before. Throughout the process I was able to learn many things and I understand that there is still many things to learn.

As of now I am not sure what I want to do when I graduate so I do hope that by taking this class I am able to further explore my options. As of now I do think that I want to go into web development.
